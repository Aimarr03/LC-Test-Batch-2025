## Overview
This is a game project that is required for Lion Core Studio Internship Test Batch 2025 for Game Programmer Division.
The game is a top-down action-packed where you control the knight to slay goblins that are remained on the area.
Each time you slay a goblin, the remaining becomes stronger as they are connected through soul bind.

These are the controllers
1. <b>WASD</b> -> To Move
2. <b>LSHIFT</b> -> To Dash
    - Dash has 3s Cooldown
3. <b>Left Click Mouse</b> -> to perform an Attack
    - You have three combos with powerful last attack

#### Closing Statement
- The commit I made for implementing is not much since I had too much fun developing it and only commit two because previously I was making it as a platform mechanic, but this one has top down.
- The experience I have developing this game mode giving me an idea on developing it further. If the time and situation is fit, I would continue developing this into a full fledge rouguelike with:
  1. More monster to slay
  2. Guardian to conquer
  3. Aids from the sky each area cleansed
