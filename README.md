##Overview
This is a game project that is required for Lion Core Studio Internship Test Batch 2025 for Game Programmer Division.
The game is a top-down action-packed where you control the knight to slay goblins that are remained on the area.
Each time you slay a goblin, the remaining becomes stronger as they are connected through soul bind.

These are the controllers
1. <b>WASD</b> -> To Move
2. <b>LSHIFT</b> -> To Dash
  2.1. Dash has 3s Cooldown
3. <b>Left Click Mouse</b> -> to perform an Attack
   3.1. You have three combos with powerful last attack

#### Closing Statement
The experience I have developing this game mode giving me an idea on developing it further. If the time and situation is fit, I would continue developing this into a full fledge rouguelike with:
1. More monster to slay
2. Guardian to conquer
3. Aids from the sky each area cleansed
